## Project description
This is a simple (my first) ML module that solves the classical problem of classyfing a given Iris flower depending on its measurments(taken in cm). <br>
this module urilizes the following python libraries:<br>
* SciPy <br>
* scikit-learn<br>
* Numpy<br>
* pandas and its visualization package<br>
The dataset is the famous Iris dataset that is found in scikit-learn.<br>
The accuracy of this module proves to be 0.97, i.e. 97%.
